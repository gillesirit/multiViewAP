# multiViewAP
Python code to test the behavior of analogical proportions when focusing on diverse sets of features

# This is related to IPMU 2024 paper: 
**Multiple viewpoint analogical proportions and their weighting** (Henri Prade - Gilles Richard)

1. Download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devvret/congressional-voting-records
2. Run jupyter notebook ipmu2024.ipynb
3. Feel free to change all parameters like: number_of_elements (default 10), the masks focus0 and focus1
4. Then observe the diverse printed numbers.
5. Note: Increasing number_of_elements (the number of loaded raws) willnecessarily increase the runtime
